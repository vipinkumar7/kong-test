# Problem

We are building a search bar that lets people do fuzzy search on different Konnect entities (services, routes, nodes). 
you're in charge of creating the backend ingest to power that service built on top of a [CDC stream](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-create-events) generated by Debezium

We have provided a jsonl file containing some sample events that can be used to
simulate input stream.


Below are the tasks we want you to complete.

* develop a program that ingests the sample cdc events into a Kafka topic
* develop a program that persists the data from Kafka into Opensearch


## Get started

Run 

```
docker-compose up -d
```

to start a Kakfa cluster. 

The cluster is accessible locally at `localhost:9092` or `kafka:29092` for services running inside the container network.


You can also access Kafka-UI at `localhost:8080` to examine the ingested Kafka messages.

Opensearch is accessible locally at `localhost:9200` or `opensearch-node:9200` 
for services running inside the container network.

You can validate Opensearch is working by running sample queries

Insert
```
curl -X PUT localhost:9200/cdc/_doc/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"foo": "bar"}'
{"_index":"cdc","_id":"1","_version":1,"result":"created","_shards":{"total":2,"successful":1,"failed":0},"_seq_no":0,"_primary_term":1}%
```

Search
```
curl localhost:9200/cdc/_search  | python -m json.tool

        "total": 1,
        "successful": 1,
        "skipped": 0,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "hits": {
        "total": {
            "value": 1,
            "relation": "eq"
        },
        "max_score": 1.0,
        "hits": [
            {
                "_index": "cdc",
                "_id": "1",
                "_score": 1.0,
                "_source": {
                    "foo": "bar"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Run

```
docker-compose down
```

to tear down all the services. 

## Resources

* `stream.jsonl` contains cdc events that need to be ingested
* `docker-compose.yaml` contains the skeleton services to help you get started
